Recommendation systems are algorithms and techniques designed to provide personalized suggestions or recommendations to users. These systems analyze user data and item attributes to generate relevant and tailored recommendations. Recommendation systems are widely used in various applications such as e-commerce (product recommendations), streaming services (movie/music recommendations), news websites (article recommendations), and more to enhance user experiences and drive engagement.
